                                    Anonymization is a data processing technique that modifies personal information so that it cannot be associated with a specific individual. Except for this section, none of the other provisions of this Privacy Policy applies to anonymized or aggregated customer data (i.e. information about our customers that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual customer).
                                    Coinbase may use anonymized or aggregate customer data for any business purpose, including to better understand customer needs and behaviors, improve our Services, conduct business intelligence and marketing, and detect security threats. We may perform our own analytics on anonymized data or enable analytics provided by third parties.
                                    Types of data we may anonymize include, transaction data, click-stream data, performance metrics, and fraud indicators.</p>

                                <p className='font-bold md:text-2xl text-xl'>HOW YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED</p>
                                <p className='text-base'>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We generally use personal information to create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our Services, content and advertising; and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. We may use this information in the following ways: <br/> <br/>
                                1) To maintain legal and regulatory compliance <br/> <br/>
                                Most of our core Services are subject to laws and regulations requiring us to collect, use, and store your personal information in certain ways. For example, CB must identify and verify customers using our Services in order to comply with anti-money laundering laws across jurisdictions. This includes collection and storage of your photo identification. In addition, we use third parties to verify your identity by comparing the personal information you provide against third-party databases and public records. When you seek to link a bank account to your CB Account, we may require you to provide additional information which we may use in collaboration with service providers acting on our behalf to verify your identity or address, and/or to manage risk as required under applicable law. If you do not provide personal information required by law, we will have to close your account. <br/> <br/>
                                2) To enforce our terms in our user agreement and other agreements <br/> <br/>
                                CB handles sensitive information, such as your identification and financial data, so it is very important for us and our customers that we actively monitor, investigate, prevent, and mitigate any potentially prohibited or illegal activities, enforce our agreements with third parties, and/or prevent and detect violations of our posted user agreement or agreements for other Services. In addition, we may need to collect fees based on your use of our Services. We collect information about your account usage and closely monitor your interactions with our Services. We may use any of your personal information collected for these purposes. The consequences of not processing your personal information for such purposes is the termination of your account. <br/> <br/>
                                3) To detect and prevent fraud and/or funds loss <br/> <br/>
                                We process your personal information in order to help detect, prevent, and mitigate fraud and abuse of our services and to protect you against account compromise or funds loss. <br/> <br/>
                                4) To provide Coinbase's Services <br/> <br/>
                                We process your personal information to provide the Services to you. For example, when you want to store funds on our platform, we require certain information such as your identification, contact information, and payment information. We cannot provide you with Services without such information. Third parties such as identity verification services may also access and/or collect your personal information when providing identity verification and/or fraud prevention services. <br/> <br/>
                                5) To provide Service communications <br/> <br/>
                                We send administrative or account-related information to you to keep you updated about our Services, inform you of relevant security issues or updates, or provide other transaction-related information. Without such communications, you may not be aware of important developments relating to your account that may affect how you can use our Services. You may not opt-out of receiving critical service communications, such as emails or mobile notifications sent for legal or security purposes. <br/> <br/>
                                6) To provide customer service <br/> <br/>
                                We process your personal information when you contact us to resolve any questions, disputes, collect fees, or to troubleshoot problems. Without processing your personal information for such purposes, we cannot respond to your requests and ensure your uninterrupted use of the Services. <br/> <br/>
                                7) To ensure quality control <br/> <br/>
                                We process your personal information for quality control and staff training to make sure we continue to provide you with accurate information. If we do not process personal information for quality control purposes, you may experience issues on the Services such as inaccurate transaction records or other interruptions. <br/> <br/>
                                8) To ensure network and information security <br/> <br/>
                                We process your personal information in order to enhance security, monitor and verify identity or service access, combat spam or other malware or security risks and to comply with applicable security laws and regulations. The threat landscape on the internet is constantly evolving, which makes it more important than ever that we have accurate and up-to-date information about your use of our Services. Without processing your personal information, we may not be able to ensure the security of our Services. <br/> <br/>
                                9) For research and development purposes <br/> <br/>
                                We process your personal information to better understand the way you use and interact with Coinbase's Services. In addition, we use such information to customize, measure, and improve Coinbase's Services and the content and layout of our website and applications, and to develop new services. Without such processing, we cannot ensure your continued enjoyment of our Services. <br/> <br/>
                                10) To enhance your experience <br/> <br/>
                                We process your personal information to provide a personalized experience, and implement the preferences you request. For example, you may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties. Without such processing, we may not be able to ensure your continued enjoyment of part or all of our Services. <br/> <br/>
                                11) To facilitate corporate acquisitions, mergers, or transactions <br/> <br/>
                                We may process any information regarding your account and use of our Services as is necessary in the context of corporate acquisitions, mergers, or other corporate transactions. <br/> <br/>
                                12) To engage in marketing activities <br/> <br/>
                                Based on your communication preferences, we may send you marketing communications (e.g. emails or mobile notifications) to inform you about our events or our partner events; to deliver targeted marketing; and to provide you with promotional offers. Our marketing will be conducted in accordance with your advertising marketing preferences and as permitted by applicable law. <br/> <br/>
                                13) To protect the health and safety of our employees and visitors, our facilities and our property and other rights. If you visit one of our locations, to maintain security at such locations you may be photographed or videotaped. <br/> <br/>
                                14) For any purpose that you provide your consent.  <br/> <br/>
                                We will not use your personal information for purposes other than those purposes we have disclosed to you, without your permission. From time to time, and as required under the applicable law, we may request your permission to allow us to share your personal information with third parties. In such instances, you may opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties, or allowing us to use your personal information for any purpose that is incompatible with the purposes for which we originally collected it or subsequently obtained your authorization. If you choose to limit the use of your personal information, certain features or CB Services may not be available to you.</p>

We generally only process your data where we are legally required to, where processing is necessary to perform any contracts we entered with you (or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you), where processing is in our legitimate interests to operate our business and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we have obtained your consent to do so.

                                <p className='text-base'>If you sign up to use the Digital Currency backed debit card Service (the “Coinbase Card”) provided by CB via the dedicated app for that Service (the “Coinbase Card App”), we will process your personal information in accordance with this Policy.
                                In order to provide the Coinbase Card Service to you, we have partnered with Paysafe Financial Services Limited and Paysafe Payment Solution Limited (collectively “Paysafe”). Paysafe is the issuer of the Coinbase Card and is a member of the Visa card scheme, which will be used to enable your Coinbase Card to operate as a normal debit card. When you sign up on the Coinbase Card App you agree to Paysafe's own terms and conditions and Privacy Policy (available at <a href="https://www.paysafe.com/paysafegroup/privacy-policy/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' className='text-blue-200'>https://www.paysafe.com/paysafegroup/privacy-policy/</a> ), and as a result Paysafe will be an independent data controller in relation to the personal information they collect and hold relating to you.
                                We may at times need to share some of your personal information that we control with Paysafe to enable us and Paysafe to provide you with the Coinbase Card Service. Where we do this, Paysafe will act as a data processor and only process your personal information to the extent necessary to enable us and Paysafe to provide the Coinbase Card Service to you.</p>
